# industrial-smoke-detection

This is the legacy code for the project of [industrial smoke detection](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/industrial-smoke-detection-and-visualization/). I am no longer maintaining this repository. If you are interested in this topic, please refer to [my later work](https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/deep-smoke-machine) using deep learning to recognize industrial smoke emissions.
